      <p>To collect micropayments, you need a digital wallet in which to receive the money. Here at Prototypr, we let content creators use our digital wallet, so you don’t have to sign up for one yourself. You can still set up your own digital wallet if you prefer, for instance if you’re also collecting micropayments from content on other websites. This guide will explain how to do it.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The digital wallets that work with Web Monetization are Uphold and Gatehub. Uphold has no withdrawal fees so we’ll go with them for this guide.</p>
      <p>Uphold is a platform for trading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It hasn’t been designed with Web Monetization in mind, so the platform has a lot of functionality that you’re probably not going to use, and the site can seem a bit overwhelming if you’re not into trading cryptocurrencies.</p>
      <p>It’s still relatively easy and pain free to set up a digital wallet with Uphold and if you follow this guide, we’ll have you set up with an Uphold account in 10 minutes (or less!).</p>

      <h2>Step by Step</h2>
      <p>The first few steps are pretty generic, so we’ll spare you too many screenshots and details:</p>
      <p><strong>1. Go to </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://Uphold.com"><strong>Uphold.com</strong></a><strong> and navigate to the sign up button</strong>. You can also download their app if you prefer, it has a similar navigation and UX.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Fill in the form with your personal details and a password of your choice</strong>. Uphold has a functionality similar to a bank, so they’re legally required to obtain your name and address -and to verify your phone number and ID -more on that later.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Answer questions on how you will use your Uphold account</strong>. These questions are mostly relevant to trading cryptocurrencies. We haven’t experienced that it makes much difference what you answer, but here’s what we found to be most accurate:</p>
